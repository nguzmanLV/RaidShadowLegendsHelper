# Raid Shadow Legends Bot - GUI

This repository contains a minimal GUI scaffold for a Raid Shadow Legends helper bot.

Quick start (Windows):

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the GUI:

```powershell
python main.py
```

Notes:
- `main.py` is a starting point: the bot loop is a placeholder. Integrate automation (image recognition, input control) later.
- Keep automation within the game's terms of service and any applicable laws.
